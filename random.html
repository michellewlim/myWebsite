    <p style = 'color: #f9b266'><font size = '5'>I like traveling and going places. If I cound go anywhere in the world I would want
    to go somewhere in Europe. Claire is in Europe right now and she says that everything is
    really high tech but people are a little rude I think. Or maybe I would want to go to Taiwan.
    Sophie says that they have great food and there is a bunch of cute cheap stuff to buy.
    I think Taiwan is the one that has good street food and snacks that you can buy at the 7/11s
    and other gas station markets. Or I think I would want to go to Indonesia. I could visit all my cousins and aunts and
    uncles and grandparent and all the places I used to go when I was little. I love the food there
    and all the desserts. I love all the markets there. Or maybe I would go to Bali which
    is technically part of Indonesia too but I would want
    to go to beach and go back to the huge market I once went to. I remember buying a bunch of
    bracelets. I think I still have some of them. If I could go back there, I think I would buy
    a lot more of them.
