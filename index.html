  <p style="padding-right: 150px; padding-left: 150px; padding-bottom: 50px;">I'm from Fremont, CA and am currently studying Computer Science and Engineering at Santa Clara University. 
    I found my passion for coding in high school and as my major probably shows, I decided to stick with it. My favorite
    part of computer science is its similarity to puzzle solving and vastness of this field. Solving coding 
    challenges gives the rush of playing a game and trying to complete a new level. The broadness of our field ensures that 
    there is always something new to learn. It's hard to get bored. Outside of computer science, I love playing volleyball 
    and doing any kind of art. I played volleyball throughout high school and also joined an intramural team in college. I 
    hope to one day travel around the world and see all the landmarks and hidden gems I've read about.

        I joined Santa Clara's Association of Computing Machinery chapter during my freshman year. I served as the underclassman
        rep and met a great community of people who are all interested in computer science. This upcoming schoolyear, I will be
        serving as the Vice President and I hope to continue to help our club grow.

          our Big Little reveal!

          This year, I joined Santa Clara University's Residence Life as a Community Facilitator (CF). Our jobs as CFs are to act 
          as a source of support for students as they navigate their time throughout college. Each residence hall has a set of CFs
          and the students living in there are assigned to one CF. Our responsibilities include planning events to build community, 
          performing rounds, and checking rooms before closing the residence halls for school breaks.

      I created an encryptor using Java, Spring, and Thymeleaf. Thymeleaf was used to create a webpage where the user
      choose which cipher they would like to use and then input the message and any necessary keys into a form. The information
      was used to create a java object and methods were applied to the message in order to encrypt it. The final encrypted
      message was displayed on the screen.
